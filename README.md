  <h3 align="center">University of Glasgow: Multimedia Analysis and Design Project</h3>
  <p align="center">
    Project at the University of Glasgow to build a multimedia essay. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I took this opportunity to build a website that explored the debate surrounding palm oil from the particular angle of palm oil deforestation.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Palm oil was chosen to be the topic of this multimedia essay as it was an area that was growing in popularity across social media and mainstream media at the time of development.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<li> 
  <ul> This project aimed to add value to existing palm oil research by creating a resource which presented reliable information regarding palm oil deforestation through the use of academic sources.</ul>
  <ul> Additionally, due to the real significance and severity of the production of palm oil, this project aimed to act as a resource which could educate users and work towards helping to improve the current damage caused by palm oil.</ul> 
</li>

### Built With

* []() HTML
* []() CSS
* []() JavaScript
* []() Balsamiq for mockups 
* []() FileZilla FTP to host internally at the University of Glasgow 

### Research Design 

* []() Paper-prototyping: the first stage in the testing process, in which participants were asked to share their opinions on the overall structure and layout of the information.
* []() Ethnographic research: participants were given tasks to carry out under observation in the Reading Room at the University of Glasgow.
* []() Surveys: participants were presented with survey questions for qualitative responses taken from recommended user experience survey questions to continue to adapt and develop the website design. 


### User Testing 

* []() The qualitative responses significantly improved with each design development and after the third paper prototype phase, all participants communicated that they enjoyed the overall website design and structure of information. 
* []() After this, the website design was developed further, taking design recommendations into account and implemented on Balsamiq. Participants were then asked to perform user tasks using Balsamiq mockups and communicate their thoughts on the overall content and technical design.
